- I am a researcher in Sociology at INRAE, France.
- Iâ€™m interested in quantitative sociology, social stratification and social change. Since 2010 I have adressed these topics in the field of food and eating practices.
- I am also head of the Masters track "[Quantifier en sciences sociales](https://master-sciences-sociales.ens.psl.eu/qess-presentation/)", hosted by ENS-PSL and EHESS, with Florence Maillochon.

Consistently with my institution's policy, I post most of my research project repos on [INRAE's gitlab](https://forgemia.inra.fr/marie.plessz).
